Write a small ATM simulator application in Java (can be console application or other types) which has the following functionalities:
- display list of commands
- select desired command
- accept input for command from the user (from the console or window)
The ATM should ask for the card number from the user and validate it against the card PIN code (4 digits).
Commands available to the user:
- login user with card number and PIN
- view available balance
- withdraw cash
- deposit cash
- change card PIN
- logoff user

The ATM application should work in conjunction with another application called the server.
The server is responsible for storing all data of the users and the server is queried by the ATM application for all relevant user operations.
A socket connection should be present as the means of communication between the client (ATM) and the server.
The format of the data used as the communication protocol is left at the discretion of the developer.

The ATM card information should be persistent in the server, meaning it should remember the available cash for each card,
even after restarting the application.
The ATM server database can be stored in a file or other methods (using a real database).
In the main method/database file, please take care to already have a user registered available for testing.
Since this is a Java application, we want to see an object-oriented approach to modelling (use classes).
Take care of the code formatting to be consistent and intelligible.
Design patterns are encouraged.
